# Rules Of Left Right Center
PlayPalace team, 2026.

## TL;DR
Left Right Center is a fast luck-based dice game where chips move around the table until only one player still has any left.

On each turn, you roll up to three six-sided dice. Each die has a Left, Right, and Center side as well as 3 dots which do nothing. Dice showing **Left** pass chips to the player on your left, **Right** pass chips to the player on your right, **Center** moves chips into the center pot (out of play), and **Dot** means you keep that chip.

The last player with any chips wins.

## Gameplay
PlayPalace Left Right Center supports **2 to 20 players**.

At game start, each player receives a configurable number of chips (default **3**, range **1 to 10**). Turn order then proceeds normally around the table.

On your turn:

* You roll a number of dice equal to the lower of **3** and your current chip count.
* If you have 3+ chips, you roll 3 dice.
* If you have 2 chips, you roll 2 dice.
* If you have 1 chip, you roll 1 die.
* If you have 0 chips, your turn is skipped, but you are not necessarily out of the game.

Each die result moves one chip:

* **Left:** Pass 1 chip to the player on your left.
* **Right:** Pass 1 chip to the player on your right.
* **Center:** Move 1 chip to the center pot.
* **Dot:** Keep that chip (no movement).

Chips placed in the center pot are removed from play and do not return.

### Example Turn
You have 3 chips and roll: **Left, Center, Dot**.

* 1 chip goes to the player on your left.
* 1 chip goes into the center pot.
* 1 chip stays with you.

You end the turn with 1 chip.

## Winning
The game ends immediately when only one active player still has chips.

That player wins, regardless of how many chips are in the center pot.
