# Rules Of Chaos Bear
PlayPalace team, 2026.

## TL;DR
Chaos Bear is a push-your-luck chase game for 2 to 4 players. You and your fellow players are being pursued by an increasingly energetic bear, and your goal is simple: don't get caught.

Each round, players roll a die to sprint forward along a number line. The bear then takes its own turn, rolling to close the gap. As the game goes on, the bear accumulates energy, making it faster and harder to outrun. If the bear reaches your position, you're out. The last player still running wins -- or, if everyone gets caught in the same bear turn, the player who made it the furthest takes the victory.

Drawing cards on special squares adds a layer of chaos to the proceedings, with effects ranging from a helpful boost forward to an unfortunate shove backward -- or even meddling with the bear's energy level.

## Gameplay
The game takes place on an infinite track. All players begin at position 30, while the bear starts at position 0. The game is divided into rounds; each round, every surviving player takes one turn, and then the bear moves.

### Player Turns
On your turn, you roll a single six-sided die (values 1 through 6) and move forward that many squares. Your turn then ends.

However, if you are standing on a position that is a positive multiple of 5 (such as 30, 35, 40, and so on), you have the option to draw a card instead of rolling. Drawing a card ends your turn as well, so you cannot both draw a card and roll in the same turn. The card you draw is random, and its effect is applied immediately. See the Cards section below for the full list of possible outcomes.

### The Bear's Turn
After all surviving players have moved, the bear takes its turn. The bear rolls a die with values 1 through 3, and then adds its current energy to the roll. The total is how far the bear moves forward -- with one exception: if the bear rolls a 3, its energy increases by 1, but that extra point of energy does not count toward movement on this turn. In effect, rolling a 3 makes the bear faster in the future without giving it extra distance right now.

The bear's energy starts at 1 and only goes up from there (it can never drop below 1). This means the bear's minimum move on any turn is 2 (a roll of 1 + energy of 1), and it only gets faster as the game progresses.

If the bear's new position is equal to or greater than any player's position, those players are caught and eliminated from the game. When the bear catches one or more players, it loses 3 energy (but never drops below 1) as it stops to feast. This is one of two things that can slow the bear down.

### Winning
The game ends when only one player remains alive -- that player wins. If the bear catches all remaining players in a single turn, the player who reached the furthest position wins. In the rare event that multiple eliminated players share the same furthest position, the game ends in a tie.

### Cards
When you are on a positive multiple of 5, you may draw a card instead of rolling. There are six possible cards, each equally likely:

* **Impulsion** -- You leap forward 3 squares. A nice little boost.
* **Super Impulsion** -- You leap forward 5 squares. Even better.
* **Tiredness** -- The bear loses 1 energy (minimum 1). This slows the bear down for everyone, not just you.
* **Hunger** -- The bear gains 1 energy. Bad news for the whole group.
* **Backward Push** -- You are shoved back 3 squares (your position cannot go below 0). Painful, especially if the bear is close.
* **Random Gift** -- A coin flip: you either move forward or backward by a random amount between 1 and 6 squares (your position cannot go below 0).

### Example Turn
It's round 1 and Alice is up first. Everyone starts at position 30, and the bear is at position 0.

Alice is on position 30, which is a multiple of 5, so she could draw a card. She decides to roll instead and gets a 4, moving to position 34.

Bob is next. He is also at position 30 and decides to draw a card. He draws Impulsion and leaps forward 3 squares to position 33.

Now the bear moves. It rolls a 2, plus its energy of 1, for a total move of 3. The bear advances from position 0 to position 3. Everyone is still safe -- for now.

In round 2, Alice rolls a 1 and moves to position 35. Bob rolls a 6 and moves to position 39. The bear rolls a 3; since it rolled its maximum, its energy increases from 1 to 2, but the extra energy point does not count this turn. The bear moves 3 + 1 = 4 (using the old energy), advancing to position 7.

Several rounds later, the bear's energy has climbed to 5 and it is now at position 48. Alice is at position 52 and Bob is at 57. Alice rolls a 2 and moves to 54, but the bear rolls 3, gaining energy to 6, and moves 3 + 5 = 8 to position 56. The bear reaches Alice at 54 -- she is caught! The bear loses 3 energy (dropping from 6 to 3) after catching her. Bob is the last player standing and wins.

## Keyboard Shortcuts
Shortcuts specific to the game of Chaos Bear:
* R: Roll the dice.
* D: Draw a card.
* C: Check the status of all players and the bear.

## Game Theory / Tips
* Since drawing a card replaces your roll for the turn, think carefully about whether it's worth the gamble. Rolling gives you a guaranteed 1-6 forward movement, while a card could give you up to +5 (Super Impulsion) but could also push you backward or power up the bear.
* Drawing a card is most appealing when you have a comfortable lead over the bear. If the bear is breathing down your neck, a reliable roll is usually safer than risking a Backward Push or Hunger card.
* Watch the bear's energy level closely. Once it climbs above 3 or 4, the bear can cover serious ground each turn. At that point, even high rolls may not keep you safe for long.
* When the bear catches a player, it loses 3 energy. This is a significant slowdown. If another player is closer to the bear than you, their misfortune buys you precious time.
* In a multiplayer game, you don't need to be the fastest -- you just need to not be the slowest. Stay ahead of at least one other player and let the bear's feast mechanic work in your favor.
