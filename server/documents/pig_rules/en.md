# Rules Of Pig
PlayPalace team, 2026.

## TL;DR
Pig is basically the quintessential dice game. In many ways it leads into more complex choices like Farkle and Toss Up.

The idea is dead simple: roll a die, add it to your running total, and decide whether to keep going or bank what you have. But if you roll a 1, you lose everything you have accumulated that turn. First player (or team) to reach the target score wins.

## Gameplay
The game is divided into rounds, and in each round every player takes one turn.

On your turn, you have two choices: roll or bank.

When you roll, a single die is thrown. If the result is anything other than a 1, the number is added to your turn score and you get to choose again - roll or bank. You can keep rolling as many times as you like, building up a bigger and bigger turn score.

However, if you roll a 1, you "bust." Your entire turn score is wiped out - you get nothing - and your turn ends immediately.

If you decide to bank instead, your accumulated turn score is added to your permanent total, your turn ends, and you pass to the next player safe and sound.

The game continues round by round until a player (or team) reaches or exceeds the target score at the end of a round. If more than one team hits the target in the same round, a tiebreaker round is played among just those tied teams.

### Customizable Options
The host can tweak several settings before the game starts:

* **Target Score:** The score needed to win. Defaults to 50, and can be set anywhere from 10 to 1,000.
* **Minimum Bank Points:** The minimum turn score you must accumulate before you are allowed to bank. Defaults to 0 (meaning you can bank at any time after at least one successful roll), and can be set up to 50. This makes the game riskier and more exciting.
* **Dice Sides:** The number of sides on the die. Defaults to 6, but can be set from 4 to 20. More sides means a lower chance of busting on each roll, which changes the strategy considerably.
* **Team Mode:** Supports individual play as well as team configurations for 2 to 4 players.

### Example Turn
The target score is 50 and you currently have 38 points total. You need 12 more to win.

You roll and get a 4. Your turn score is now 4. That is nowhere near enough, so you roll again.

You get a 5. Turn score: 9. Still not quite there. One more roll should do it.

You get a 2. Turn score: 11. SO close! That's just one point away from victory, but someone else is hot on your heels. You decide to go for it and roll again.

Oh no, a 1. You lose all your points that turn, and the next player is up.

## Game Theory / Tips
* With a standard 6-sided die, the math says you should bank once you have accumulated about 20 points in a turn. Below that, the expected gain from rolling again outweighs the risk of busting.
* If the minimum bank threshold is set higher than 0, you are forced to take on more risk. In that case, once you clear the minimum, consider banking immediately unless you are far behind.
* With more sides on the die (say 12 or 20), the chance of rolling a 1 drops significantly. You can afford to be more aggressive and push for bigger turn scores.
* Pay attention to your opponents' scores. If someone is about to win, you may need to throw caution to the wind and go for a big turn, even if it means a higher chance of busting.
* Conversely, if you have a comfortable lead, there is no shame in banking small amounts to inch over the finish line safely.
