# Rules Of Crazy Eights
PlayPalace team, 2026.

## TL;DR
Crazy Eights is a classic shedding card game where the goal is to be the first player to get rid of all your cards. It has been a family favorite for generations, and if you have ever played UNO, you already know the basic idea -- Crazy Eights is, in fact, the game that inspired UNO.

Players take turns matching the top card of the discard pile by suit or rank, using eights as wild cards to change the suit at will. The first player to empty their hand wins the round and scores points based on the cards left in their opponents' hands. Play continues across multiple rounds until someone reaches the winning score.

## Gameplay
The game supports 2 to 8 players and uses two standard 52-card decks shuffled together. Each round, every player is dealt 5 cards, and a starting card is turned face-up from the deck to begin the discard pile. This starting card will always be a numbered card (never a wild or face card).

The dealer rotates each round, and the player to the dealer's left goes first.

On your turn, you must play a card from your hand that matches either the suit or the rank of the top card on the discard pile. For example, if the top card is a 7 of Hearts, you can play any Heart or any 7 from another suit.

### Special Cards
Not all cards are created equal. There are four types of special cards that shake things up:

* **Eights (Wild):** Eights can be played on top of anything, at any time. When you play an eight, you choose the suit that the next player must follow. This is the most powerful card in the game.
* **Queens (Skip):** Playing a queen skips the next player's turn entirely.
* **Jacks (Reverse):** Playing a jack reverses the direction of play. In a two-player game, since reversing direction has the same effect as skipping, it simply skips the other player instead.
* **Kings (Draw Two):** Playing a king forces the next player to draw 2 cards from the deck and lose their turn.

### Drawing and Passing
If you have no playable cards in your hand, you must draw one card from the deck. If the card you drew is playable, you have the option to play it immediately. If it is not playable (or you choose not to play it), you pass and your turn ends.

You cannot draw if you already have a playable card in your hand -- the game requires you to play when you can. There is also a hand size limit of 15 cards; if your hand is full, you cannot draw and must pass instead.

If the draw pile runs out, the discard pile (except for the top card) is reshuffled to form a new draw pile.

### Example Turn
It is the start of the round and you are dealt: 3 of Clubs, 7 of Hearts, Queen of Diamonds, 5 of Hearts, and an Eight. The starting card is the 6 of Hearts.

You could play the 7 of Hearts (matching the Hearts suit) or the 5 of Hearts. You could also play your 8, but you have no reason to.

You play the 7 of Hearts. The next player now needs to match Hearts or 7. They play the 7 of Spades (matching rank). The player after them plays a King of Spades -- meaning the next person draws two cards and gets skipped.

A few turns later, the top card is the 10 of Clubs and you have no Clubs and no 10s, but you still have that Eight. You play the Eight, choose Hearts as the new suit, and now the next player has to follow Hearts. You are down to your last few cards and well on your way to winning the round.

### Scoring
When a player empties their hand, the round ends and they score points based on what remains in all other players' hands. The card values are:

* **Eights (Wild):** 50 points each
* **Kings, Queens, Jacks (Face cards):** 20 points each
* **Aces:** 1 point each
* **Number cards (2-7, 9-10):** Face value (e.g., a 5 is worth 5 points)

The winner of the round collects points from every opponent. For example, if one opponent is left holding an Eight and a 3, that is 53 points from them alone. All opponents' totals are added together for your round score.

The game continues across multiple rounds, with scores accumulating, until a player reaches the winning score (500 by default, but this is configurable up to 10,000).

## Keyboard Shortcuts
Shortcuts specific to the game of Crazy Eights:

* **Space:** Draw a card from the deck.
* **P:** Pass your turn (after drawing).
* **C:** Read the top card on the discard pile.
* **E:** Read card counts (how many cards each player holds and how many remain in the deck).
* **Shift+T:** Check the turn timer.

When choosing a suit after playing a wild (Eight):

* **C:** Choose Clubs.
* **D:** Choose Diamonds.
* **H:** Choose Hearts.
* **S:** Choose Spades.

## Game Theory / Tips
* Save your eights for when you truly need them. They are your get-out-of-jail-free cards, and playing one early just because you can is a waste.
* Pay attention to what suits your opponents seem to be short on. If someone keeps drawing, they probably lack the current suit. Changing to that suit (via a wild or natural play) can keep the pressure on them.
* Kings are best played strategically. Forcing a draw-two on the player who is close to going out can turn the tide of a round.
* If someone else is about to win the round, try to get rid of your cards in descending order of point value. If they have one card left and have used a wild, even if you could follow suit, you should instead play as many eights as possible.
* Especially in games with two players, it is sometimes possible to play a combination of cards that allows you to win the round without them being able to do anything about it. This is quite fun, especially making your opponents draw cards that they have no chance to play.
