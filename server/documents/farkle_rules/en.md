# Rules Of Farkle
PlayPalace team, 2026.

## TL;DR
Farkle is a push-your-luck game which dates back to at least the 18th century. It is probably one of the most well-known dice games in the blind community, and you may have played it before on any number of platforms.

The goal is to make combinations of dice without getting Farkles (rolls entirely devoid of valid combinations).

Each combination is worth a number of points. Victory is achieved when someone's score passes a certain threshold; 500, 1,000, 3,000 and 5,000 are common choices.

## Gameplay
The game is divided into distinct rounds, in which everyone takes a turn.
On your turn, you will start with six dice. At this point, your only choice is to roll.

Then, take any combinations you see fit, adding their value to your turn score; to be clear, you aren't obliged to take every combination you roll. That is one strategic part of the game.

The dice you haven't used in combinations (either because they didn't form any valid ones or because you chose not to take the ones they formed) can be rolled again.

If you manage to use all six of your dice, you'll get a fresh new set - this is known as having obtained "Hot Dice", and can be done many times in one turn if you're lucky.

That said, if you do not roll any valid combinations, you are considered to have Farkled; your turn ends and all your accumulated points are forfeited.

If you have enough points and think the risk outweighs the reward, you bank your turn score, adding it to your total and ending your turn.
Some tables also use an Initial Bank Score option, which requires at least that many points before your first successful bank of the game.

## Options
* Target Score (500-5000, default 500): points needed to win.
* Initial Bank Score (0-1000, default 0): minimum points required for your first bank only.
* Hot Dice Multiplier (off/on, default off): A high risk, high reward variant. Each time hot dice  is rolled increases your turn multiplier by 1 for the rest of that turn (first hot dice: x2, second: x3, third: x4, and so on). It resets when you bank or Farkle.

### Example Turn
It's the start of the game and you're up first.

You have rolled 1-2-3-4-5-6. You take the large straight (worth 200 points), and achieve hot dice.

You roll again: 1-2-2-2-6-6. You can choose to take only the single 1 (for 10 points). The three twos (valued at 20 points) might not be worth collecting, as you could reroll those dice and potentially earn more.

If you choose to take the single 1 (+10->210 turn score), you should probably roll your remaining dice: they land on 1-1-4-4-5. Indeed, you take your two ones (10 points each), your five (5 points) and bank, for a total score of 235.

## Keyboard Shortcuts
Shortcuts specific to the game of Farkle:
* R: Roll the dice.
* B: Bank your score.
* C: Check the turn score of the player whose turn it is.

## Game Theory / Tips
* I find it's best to bank when you have 35+ points with 1 die, 40+ with 2 dice, and 50+ in all other cases.
* Don't take fives when you have other options, or at least don't take many, if you aren't going to bank immediately after. If you would end up with fewer than three dice to reroll (unless you'd get hot dice of course), that's when you start taking them.
