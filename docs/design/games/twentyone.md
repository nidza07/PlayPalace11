## Overview

This game resembles blackjack: the deck has eleven cards numbered 1-11, and the total of your hand must be closer to (usually) 21 than your opponent to win.

## Round Flow

- Both players receive 2 number cards. The first is hidden so only you can see it, whereas the second card is visible to everyone.
- you can `hit` to draw another card, `stand` to end your turn, or play a change card if you have one.
- When you hit, other players will see what card was drawn. Both players pull from the same deck and there are no repeated numbers. 
- Hitting also creates a chance to draw a change card. These are hidden from your opponent.
- The round ends when all players stand without drawing or using a card.
- At the end of the round, your hidden number cards are revealed and your totals are compared with the target number, which is 21 by default. If you have exactly this number, or more than your opponent without going over, you win. If you have more than this number (bust) but your opponent has less, you lose. If you both bust, whoever is closer to the target wins. If you have the same total, everyone loses.

## Bets, Damage and scoring
You start with 0 points. Each round starts with a bet of 1 for each player. Some change cards alter this amount. At the end of the round, the loser will gain the number of points equal to their bet. Any player who Reaches 10 points loses the game.

## Change Card Summary

Change cards allow you to change the conditions of the game to be more favorable for your current hand. You can raise your opponent's bet, or lower your own. You can draw specific numbers from the deck if available, or draw the best card for your current situation. You can change the target from 21 to a different number, return you or your opponent's last drawn card to the top of the deck, or even negate your opponent's other change cards.

## Tips And Strategy

- The limited number of cards makes it easier to guess your opponent's bottom card in advance. These possibilities narrow further the more cards that are drawn.
- The change cards to draw specific numbers can also be used to guess an opponent's bottom card. The number will only be drawn if it is available in the deck to be drawn. Therefore, if it is not drawn, not in your hand, and not visible in the opponent's hand, it is your opponent's bottom card.
- Without knowing your opponent's bottom card, the safest strategy is to determine the best number they could have, then play as if they have it. Don't be afraid to change this guess as the round progresses.
- To win the game, your opponent needs to score 10 before you do. If you can't win outright, use change cards so the loss costs you less points.
